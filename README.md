# Assignment-4
This repository includes a PHP script that builds a projects table in a MySQL database and stores data about web development projects for my portfolio website.
Follow these steps to put up my website for my portfolio as a web developer:
Clone the Repository
Update the database credentials by opening the setup.php file in a text editor.
Run the setup.php script from the command line or in my browser
By putting HTML, CSS, and PHP files in the appropriate directory on my web server following the execution of the setup script, I can now view my portfolio website.
